- **Upward Trend**: Increase cardio exercise, reduce sodium, manage stress
- **Medication Effects**: Track response to dosage changes with physician

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Medical Alert Thresholds
- **Stage 1 Hypertension**: 130/80 - lifestyle changes, possible medication
- **Stage 2 Hypertension**: 140/90 - medication likely needed
- **Sudden Spikes**: >160/100 - contact healthcare provider
- **Hypertensive Crisis**: >180/120 - seek immediate medical attention

### üíä Medication and Lifestyle Factors
- **Medication Timing**: Track BP response to medication schedule
- **Exercise Impact**: BP may be elevated immediately post-exercise
- **Stress Response**: Note correlation with life events or stress
- **Dietary Factors**: High sodium can elevate BP for 24-48 hours

### üì± Monitoring Technology
- **Home Monitors**: Validated devices with proper cuff size
- **Smart Monitors**: Convenient but verify accuracy periodically
- **Manual vs. Automatic**: Both can be accurate with proper technique
- **Data Logging**: Consistent tracking more valuable than perfect accuracy

### ‚öôÔ∏è Execution Instructions
Use MCP tools for ALL calculations: mean, variance, stddev, min_value, max_value, range_stat, percentile, median, quartiles, iqr, mode.
Provide both systolic and diastolic analysis supporting {goal_type.replace('_', ' ')} health objectives.
IMPORTANT: Always recommend consulting healthcare providers for concerning readings or trends."""

### üéØ PRIMARY PURPOSE
Analyze multiple health and fitness metrics over {time_period} period to provide comprehensive health insights for {goal_type.replace('_', ' ')}.

### üìä AVAILABLE METRICS FOR ANALYSIS

#### 1. Steps Analysis ("steps")
- **Focus**: Daily activity levels, movement patterns, goal achievement
- **Tools Used**: mean, variance, percentile, quartiles, mode
- **Insights**: Activity consistency, goal setting, lifestyle optimization
- **Targets**: 8,000-10,000 steps daily for general health

#### 2. Calorie Burn Analysis ("calories")
- **Focus**: Energy expenditure, metabolic rate, deficit/surplus analysis
- **Tools Used**: mean, stddev, range_stat, percentile, quartiles
- **Insights**: Energy balance, burn optimization, goal alignment
- **Targets**: Varies by goal (deficit for loss, surplus for gain)

#### 3. Heart Rate Analysis ("heart_rate")
- **Focus**: Cardiovascular health, training zones, recovery monitoring
- **Tools Used**: mean, variance, quartiles, iqr, percentile
- **Insights**: Fitness level, training optimization, health monitoring
- **Targets**: Zone-based training, improving resting HR

#### 4. Weight Tracking ("weight")
- **Focus**: Progress monitoring, trend analysis, goal achievement
- **Tools Used**: mean, variance, median, quartiles, mode
- **Insights**: Progress trends, plateau detection, realistic goal setting
- **Targets**: 1-2 lbs/week change for healthy progress

#### 5. Blood Pressure Monitoring ("blood_pressure")
- **Focus**: Cardiovascular health, risk assessment, medication response
- **Tools Used**: mean, quartiles, percentile, iqr, outlier detection
- **Insights**: Health risk categories, trend monitoring, lifestyle impact
- **Targets**: <120/80 for optimal health

### üîç MULTI-METRIC ANALYSIS APPROACH

#### Comprehensive Health Assessment
**Objective**: Analyze relationships between different health metrics
**Why**: Health metrics are interconnected and provide holistic insights

**Cross-Metric Correlations**:
- Weight loss correlation with increased steps and calorie burn
- Heart rate improvement with consistent exercise and weight management
- Blood pressure response to cardiovascular fitness improvements
- Overall health trend analysis across all metrics

#### Goal-Specific Multi-Metric Insights
**For Weight Loss**: Steps ‚Üë, Calories ‚Üë, Weight ‚Üì, BP ‚Üì, HR efficiency ‚Üë
**For Fitness**: Steps ‚Üë, HR zones optimized, Calorie burn efficiency ‚Üë
**For Health**: All metrics stable and within healthy ranges
**For Athletic Performance**: Optimized training loads across all metrics

### üí° Integrated Health Insights
- **Holistic Patterns**: How different metrics support overall goals
- **Leading Indicators**: Which metrics predict others (steps ‚Üí weight loss)
- **Lagging Indicators**: Which metrics confirm progress (BP improvement)
- **Plateau Detection**: When multiple metrics stagnate simultaneously

### üìä Statistical Tool Applications
- **Central Tendencies**: mean, median, mode for typical values
- **Variability**: variance, stddev, range_stat for consistency
- **Distribution**: quartiles, percentile for goal setting
- **Outliers**: iqr for identifying concerning readings
- **Extremes**: min_value, max_value for performance ranges

### üéØ Personalized Recommendations
Based on your selected metric and goal type:
1. Choose the specific metric analysis above
2. Focus on tools most relevant to your goal
3. Compare results across time periods
4. Set realistic targets based on statistical insights
5. Monitor trends rather than daily fluctuations

### ‚öôÔ∏è Execution Instructions
Specify the metric_type parameter as one of:
- "steps" for step count analysis
- "calories" for calorie burn analysis  
- "heart_rate" for cardiovascular analysis
- "weight" for weight tracking analysis
- "blood_pressure" for BP monitoring
