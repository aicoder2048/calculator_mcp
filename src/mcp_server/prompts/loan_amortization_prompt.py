### üéØ PRIMARY PURPOSE
Calculate the monthly payment for a loan of ${principal:,.2f} at {annual_rate}% annual interest rate over {term_years} years, using precise amortization formulas and MCP tools.

### üìä MAIN GOALS
1. **Payment Calculation** - Determine exact monthly payment amount
2. **Total Cost Analysis** - Calculate lifetime cost of the loan
3. **Interest Breakdown** - Understand total interest paid over loan term
4. **Payment Verification** - Validate calculations using alternative methods

### üîç SUB-GOALS AND APPROACH

#### Goal 1: Monthly Payment Calculation
**Objective**: Calculate the fixed monthly payment using the standard loan formula
**Why**: This determines the borrower's monthly financial obligation

**Payment Formula**: PMT = P √ó [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
Where: P = Principal, r = Monthly interest rate, n = Total payments

**Step 1.1**: Convert annual rate to monthly decimal rate
   - Purpose: Loans are typically paid monthly, requiring rate conversion
   - Calculate annual rate as decimal: divide({annual_rate}, 100) = {annual_rate/100}
   - Calculate monthly rate: divide(annual_decimal, 12) = {monthly_rate:.6f}
   - Expected outcome: Monthly interest rate in decimal form

**Step 1.2**: Calculate total number of payments
   - Purpose: Determine total payment periods for the loan
   - Calculate: multiply({term_years}, 12) = {total_months} payments
   - Significance: This is 'n' in the payment formula

**Step 1.3**: Calculate compound interest factor (1+r)^n
   - Purpose: This represents the total growth factor over the loan term
   - Method: add(1, {monthly_rate:.6f}) = {1 + monthly_rate:.6f}
   - Power calculation: power({1 + monthly_rate:.6f}, {total_months})
   - Expected outcome: Compound factor for {total_months} months
   - Financial meaning: How much $1 grows over the loan term

**Step 1.4**: Calculate numerator [r(1+r)^n]
   - Purpose: Top part of the payment formula
   - Multiply rate by compound factor: multiply({monthly_rate:.6f}, compound_factor)
   - Expected outcome: Numerator for payment calculation

**Step 1.5**: Calculate denominator [(1+r)^n - 1]
   - Purpose: Bottom part of the payment formula
   - Subtract 1 from compound factor: subtract(compound_factor, 1)
   - Expected outcome: Denominator for payment calculation
   - Financial meaning: Total interest growth over loan term

**Step 1.6**: Calculate payment ratio
   - Purpose: Get the payment multiplier per dollar borrowed
   - Divide numerator by denominator: divide(numerator, denominator)
   - Expected outcome: Payment factor per $1 of principal

**Step 1.7**: Calculate final monthly payment
   - Purpose: Determine actual payment amount
   - Multiply principal by payment factor: multiply({principal}, payment_factor)
   - Expected outcome: Fixed monthly payment amount
   - Practical significance: Amount due each month

#### Goal 2: Total Loan Cost Analysis
**Objective**: Calculate the total amount paid over the life of the loan
**Why**: Understanding the full financial commitment of borrowing

**Step 2.1**: Calculate total payments
   - Purpose: Find lifetime cost of the loan
   - Method: multiply(monthly_payment, {total_months})
   - Expected outcome: Total amount paid over {term_years} years
   - Context: This includes both principal and interest

**Step 2.2**: Calculate total interest paid
   - Purpose: Understand the cost of borrowing
   - Method: subtract(total_payments, {principal})
   - Expected outcome: Total interest over loan life
   - Financial impact: Extra cost beyond the borrowed amount

#### Goal 3: Interest vs Principal Breakdown
**Objective**: Understand how payments are allocated between interest and principal
**Why**: Early payments are mostly interest, later payments mostly principal

**Step 3.1**: First payment breakdown
   - Interest portion: multiply({principal}, {monthly_rate:.6f})
   - Principal portion: subtract(monthly_payment, interest_portion)
   - Remaining balance: subtract({principal}, principal_portion)
   - Pattern: Early payments have high interest, low principal

**Step 3.2**: Interest-to-principal ratio
   - Purpose: Show the cost efficiency of the loan
   - Calculate ratio: divide(total_interest, {principal})
   - Interpretation: How many times the principal you pay in interest
   - Example: Ratio of 0.5 means 50% extra cost in interest

#### Goal 4: Verification and Alternative Calculations
**Objective**: Validate results using different approaches
**Why**: Ensure accuracy and provide payment alternatives

**Step 4.1**: Payment verification through amortization
   - Method: Calculate if monthly payment exactly pays off loan in {total_months} months
   - Track remaining balance after each payment
   - Validation: Balance should be exactly $0 after final payment

**Step 4.2**: Interest rate check
   - Calculate effective annual rate: power(add(1, {monthly_rate:.6f}), 12)
   - Subtract 1 and multiply by 100 for percentage
   - Should equal {annual_rate}% annual rate

### üìä Loan Summary
- **Principal**: ${principal:,.2f}
- **Annual Interest Rate**: {annual_rate}%
- **Loan Term**: {term_years} years ({total_months} payments)
- **Monthly Interest Rate**: {monthly_rate:.6f} ({monthly_rate*100:.4f}%)

### üí° Financial Insights
- **Early Payment Impact**: Extra principal payments save substantial interest
- **Payment Timing**: Interest is highest in early years, principal in later years
- **Refinancing Consideration**: Lower rates may justify refinancing costs
- **Payment Schedule**: Fixed payments provide budget predictability

### üìê Formula Reference
- Monthly Payment: PMT = P √ó [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
- Total Interest: (PMT √ó n) - P
- Remaining Balance: P √ó [(1+r)^n - (1+r)^p] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
  (where p = payments made)

### üéØ PRIMARY PURPOSE
Compare Equal Monthly Payment (EMP) vs Equal Principal Payment (EPP) methods for a ${principal:,.2f} loan.

### üìä MAIN GOALS
1. **EMP Analysis** - Equal monthly payments (standard amortization)
2. **EPP Analysis** - Equal principal payments (declining interest)
3. **Cost Comparison** - Total interest comparison between methods
4. **Cash Flow Analysis** - Monthly payment patterns over time

### üîç SUB-GOALS AND APPROACH

#### Goal 1: Equal Monthly Payment Method
**Objective**: Calculate standard loan with fixed payments
**Why**: Most common loan structure - predictable payments

**Step 1.1**: Calculate fixed monthly payment
   - Use standard formula: PMT = P √ó [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
   - Result: Same payment amount each month

**Step 1.2**: Total cost calculation
   - Method: multiply(monthly_payment, {total_months})
   - Purpose: Total cash outflow with EMP method

#### Goal 2: Equal Principal Payment Method
**Objective**: Calculate loan with fixed principal, declining interest
**Why**: Alternative method - higher initial payments, lower total interest

**Step 2.1**: Calculate fixed principal payment
   - Method: divide({principal}, {total_months})
   - Purpose: Equal principal reduction each month

**Step 2.2**: First month payment calculation
   - Interest: multiply({principal}, {monthly_rate:.6f})
   - Total payment: add(principal_payment, interest_payment)
   - Pattern: Payments decline each month as balance reduces

**Step 2.3**: Total interest with EPP
   - Formula: P √ó r √ó (n + 1) / 2
   - Method: Use MCP tools to calculate
   - Result: Lower total interest than EMP

#### Goal 3: Method Comparison

### üîç GENERAL LOAN ANALYSIS APPROACH

#### Standard Loan Formula
PMT = P √ó [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
Where:
- P = Principal amount (${principal:,.2f})
- r = Monthly interest rate ({annual_rate}% √∑ 12 √∑ 100 = {monthly_rate:.6f})
- n = Total payments ({term_years} √ó 12 = {total_months})

#### Key Calculations Using MCP Tools
1. **Rate conversion**: divide({annual_rate}, 12), then divide by 100
2. **Compound factor**: power(add(1, monthly_rate), {total_months})
3. **Payment calculation**: Use multiply, divide, add, subtract
4. **Interest analysis**: subtract(total_payments, principal)

### üí° Loan Considerations
- **Interest front-loading**: Early payments are mostly interest
